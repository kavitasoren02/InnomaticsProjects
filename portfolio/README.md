## Projects

### **News API**
A web application that fetches real-time news from various sources using the News API. It allows users to stay updated with the latest news articles from different categories.

### **BookMyShow**
A movie ticket booking application where users can browse and book tickets for movies, view show timings, and select theaters. It mimics the functionality of the popular BookMyShow platform.

Through these projects, I hope to illustrate my proficiency in web development, problem-solving, and creating engaging user experiences.
